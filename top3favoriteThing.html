			<p> My favorite of all times</p>

		<h2> Eragon(Movie) </h2>
		<img src="images/eragon.jpg">	
		<p> Talks about a farmer boy named Eragon who find a mysterious stone. Not knowing the origin of the stone and trying to sell it to a butcher as money. Later realize that it was egg that hatched a dragon -Eragon.</p>	
		<p> I liked this movie because it was so intruging. The movie made it seem like the dragon was special and people who don't know that they had this special talent are able to be dragon rider. </p>
		<h3> Ai Otsuka</h3>

		<p> A japanese pop singer and songwriter from Osaka,Japan. A popular artist in 2003 at Avex Tax label for her song Sakuranbo.Also was in the Top 200 Oricon weekly and was on Singles Chart for 103 weeks </p>	  
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aQMM4rYJPE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Her melody of the song make you feel sad or hurt deep down. I like this song because it soothes me when I am sad or angry. While also it helps me forget all the pain I had to go through in trying to bear. </p>
		<h4> Healer (Korean Drama) </h4>
		<img src="images/healer.jpg">
		<p> About a group of friends who did a illegal broadcoasting station creating a illegal mercenary codename healer who has good fighting skills  trying to uncover the truth.</p>
		<p> I like this drama based on how the story goes on. To where it makes me laugh at very beginning. While also feeling sad at the middle of the drama. Also feeling happy at how the drama ends.</p>
